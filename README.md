# My framework

Just a framework created for fun and learning purposes. It is not intended for production use.

## Fast refresh

This framework supports fast refresh for a better development experience. Changes made to the code will be reflected in
real-time without needing to restart the application. 

To enable fast refresh, you need to define in `.env` file the value of `MY_FRAMEWORK_ENVIRONMENT` variable to `development`.
